## Monster Game
Monster Game is a terminal-based monster training, battling, and trading game built with Python. Players can collect, level up, and trade monsters of different elemental types while battling opponents in a turn-based system. The game uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and SQLite for persistent storage.

## Features
 1. Turn-Based Battle System
Engage in classic turn-based battles where speed, attack, and defense stats determine the outcome. Use tactics, type advantages, and monster levels to win fights.

 2. Player Progression
Players earn Experience Points (XP) by battling or training. Leveling up unlocks new abilities, strengthens monsters, and can even trigger monster evolution.

 3. Monster Training
Choose which monster to train and gain XP through specialized routines. This allows your monsters to improve outside of battle, giving you an edge in future encounters.

 4. Achievements System
Track your milestones and earn achievements for goals such as winning 10 battles, evolving a monster, or trading with 5 players.

 5. Monster Trading
Trade monsters with other players. This system enables co-op style gameplay and adds a social layer to your in-game progression.

 6. Modular and Extensible Codebase
The codebase is organized into modules such as battle_engine, game_logic, and player, making it easy to extend functionality (e.g., add quests, more types, AI enemies).

 7. SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
Persistent storage of player data, monsters, and battles using SQLAlchemy. Easily switch to another database backend in the future.

8. Testing Suite
Includes unit tests for battle logic, game progression, and monster management â€” ensuring the game is reliable and maintainable.
